# [Olive-Editor](https://github.com/olive-editor/olive)-Artwo-Effects
Effects that I need for Olive Editor. I was able to create this thanks to the initiative of [cgvirus](https://github.com/cgvirus), you can find his project [Olive-Editor-Community-Effects here](https://github.com/cgvirus/Olive-Editor-Community-Effects)

## Install:
- Download the zip file and extract it.
  - Inside there is `Olive-Editor-Artwo-Effects-master`

#### For Windows and Mac:
- Open the Olive-Editor installation/portable directory. There is a folder named `effects`
- Copy the extracted folder named `Olive-Editor-Artwo-Effects-master`
- Paste it in Olive's `effects` folder (for MAC it's probably `Effects`)

#### For Linux
- Open this location: `~/.local/share/olivevideoeditor.org/Olive`
- Create a folder name `effects`
- Copy the extracted forlder named `Olive-Editor-Artwo-Effects-master`
- Paste it in Olive's `effects` folder.

#### For individual effect downloads:
- Click in the effect folder you want to download
- Copy the link and paste in http://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/ to download
- Extract the zip and copy-paste the extracted folder just like above

***MUST: you have to make sure the folder COMMON is present in your `effect` folder***
means you should download the `COMMON`folder at least once for individual download.
